I will use the URL shortener solution as well. First off, I would design this URL shortener to be an API instead of a full app, probably a REST-API, as there is no need for it to be a full app. I would then create an endpoint for this API for generating a shortlink â€” this endpoint of the API is where users interact with the API to create a shortlink. The users could insert the slug of the URL of their liking, or if they don't, I would have a random slug generator that uses RNG and a string of possible characteres to be used in a URL slug. Next, I would add another endpoint that redirects the shortlink to the original link's destination. After this, I would use a NoSQL database to store and access these slugs. I chose not to use a regular SQL database because the 'relational' aspect is not that important. Additionally, NoSQL databases generally have faster for queries. By linking this URL shortener API to the Twilio Fax API, this successfully solves the problem presented.
